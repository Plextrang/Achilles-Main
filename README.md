**Miniworld:**
  - The database represents an online shoe store containing various brands and styles.
  - Within this online store, customers can browse through shoes of differnt brands, colors, and sizes via a filtered search
  - Customers are able to view and edit their shopping card
  - Customers are given a discount if they make a purchase past a certian limit

**Set-up:**
  - To smoothly run this project, you will need to install:
    - NodeJS (version >= 16.6)
    - VS Code
    - Packages (type in "npm install" into the VS Code terminal). If the application is returning errors, check this first. 
    - Scripts (type in "npm start" into the VS Code terminal)

**Starting the Application locally:**
  - Once you have the files downloaded, type in _npm install_ into your Command Prompt or VS Code terminal to install all the required packages.
  - Since both the front-end and back-end of the application is in one repository (this one), once you have entered into the "client" folder via _cd client_, type in _npm start_ into the the terminal and this will start the front-end. Then in another terminal, enter into the "api" folder via _cd api_ and type in _npm start_ into the terminal and this will start the back-end.
